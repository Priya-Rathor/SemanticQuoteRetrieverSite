# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Model Details

- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 256 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 384 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
<!-- - **Training Dataset:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **Language:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **License:** Unknown -->

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ü§ó Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    '‚Äúi believe the universe wants to be noticed. i think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. and who am i, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?‚Äù - john green, [john-green, tfios, the-fault-in-our-stars]',
    '‚Äúi believe the universe wants to be noticed. i think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. and who am i, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?‚Äù',
    "‚Äúdon't you think it's better to be extremely happy for a short while, even if you lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life?‚Äù",
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 384]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.9852, 0.0722],
#         [0.9852, 1.0000, 0.0934],
#         [0.0722, 0.0934, 1.0000]])
